# Odin recipes

## What is this?
This is my first The Odin Project project. The intention is to build a website with multiple recipes.

Knowledge needed:
- HTML
- Git
- Command line

Conclusions:
- Basic HTML functions were easily comprehended.
- I still have to internalise the usage of git; when, what and how to commit.
- My translation of traditional Slovenian recipes to English might be slightly awkward and the recipes choice was probably unnecessary complication, yet it gave my website relatable content.
